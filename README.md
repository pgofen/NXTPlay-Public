# NXTPlay Formation Detection Project

Welcome to P-NXTPlay â€” a machine learning incubator project built in partnership with the Pomona-Pitzer Football program to detect offensive formations using computer vision and spatial data. This repository contains samples of work created by the Football AI Team.

## Overview
Our goal was to streamline a core workflow for coaches: manually tagging and labeling each play during practices. By using player tracking data and visual input, we aimed to:
- Automatically identify offensive formations
- Quantify tendencies by formation
- Save time for coaches while increasing insight quality

## Technical Approach
We built a neural network that takes in a 3D array of player coordinate data and outputs the offensive formation.

### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas / NumPy
- YOLOv8 / OpenCV
